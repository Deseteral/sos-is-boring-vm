Simple virtual machine.

## Specification
The virtual machine is based on imaginary specification. The document with CPU

Only required dependency is GCC with g++.

To build, execute Makefile found in project's root directory:
```
make
```

If you want to build only VM or Assembler:
```
make vm
make asm
```

## Testing
Coming soon :)
